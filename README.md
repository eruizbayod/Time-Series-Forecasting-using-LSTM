# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-LSTM
Predicting future temperature(Huge weather data ) using techniques like Moving window average and LSTM(single and multi step).
Data Link : Max Plank Institute, https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/
Built Simple Moving window average and Complex LSTM architecture (LSTM-32 , adam optimizer , over 10 epochs), got an MAE of 0.19.
Made use of single(temperature) and multi(temp, pressure, density) features to build the model
